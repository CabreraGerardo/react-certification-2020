## Mini-Challenge 2 Questions:

1. Using `create-react-app`, what do we need to set up for testing?

   - The projects created with `create-react-app` already have `Jest` and the `react-testing-library` as default, but you can use an external library if you want.
   - To test, you'll need to create an \*.test.js where you are going to set up your test.

2. What components are worth to test in your development?

   - The ones that render data and the ones that change after some event.

3. Can you apply TDD once you already created components?
   - Yes, but the idea of TDD is to write the test first in order to code with that in mind.
